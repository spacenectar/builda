# %SENTENCE_CASE%

This app was built using the ['Test'](https://github.com/builda-modules/prefab-test) prefab from https://builda.app

## Running the website locally

To make changes to the website beyond updating docs or tweaking components in
storybook (see below), you will need to install the project locally via
`yarn install`. Then run the following command:

```bash
 yarn dev
```

## Storybook

If you just want to tweak the website, you can use the storybook to preview the
components that we use and make changes to them (you will still need to run
`yarn install` first).

```bash
 yarn storybook
```
