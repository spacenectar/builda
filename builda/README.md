ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨ This is an **alpha** version of Builda. It is not ready for production use.
The documentation is incomplete and the application has not been fully tested. Use
at your own risk. ðŸš¨ ðŸš¨

## Setup

You can either install `builda` as a global module or install it locally into your
project, if you are using the `.builda.json` file, installing locally is recommended.

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-install_globally-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm)

```bash
npm i -g builda
```

![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/yarn-install_globally-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=yarn)

```bash
yarn global add builda
```

![NPM](https://img.shields.io/badge/npm-install_locally-red?style=for-the-badge&logo=npm)

```bash
npm i --dev builda
```

![Yarn](https://img.shields.io/badge/yarn-install_locally-yellow?style=for-the-badge&logo=yarn)

```bash
yarn add -d builda
```

Then you can initialise builda by typing `builda --init` this will create a `.builda.json`
file in your project root. (see [Configuration](#configuration) below)

## Usage

Once you have installed builda, you can use it to build your project files.

<!-- ## Screenshot

The component produced in this animation is available to view here: https://github.com/foxleigh81/builda/tree/master/examples/my-example-component -->

## Configuration

You can specify some defaults by creating a `.builda.json` file in your home directory.

You can create this file manually or by running `builda --init`

## Generating files

When you run `builda --init`, you will generate scaffold types which can be used 
to generate files. Each scaffold type is converted into a runnable command.

For example, if you generated a `component` scaffold-type, you could run:

```bash
builda component my-example-component
```

This will generate a component called `my-example-component` in the directory specified
in the `.builda.json` file under the `component` command.

If you generated an `atom` scaffold-type, you could run:

```bash
builda atom my-example-atom
```

This will generate an atom called `my-example-atom` in the directory specified
in the `.builda.json` file under the `atom` command.

This is a powerful feature as not only does it allow you to specify the directory
to generate files in, it also allows you to specify the scaffold to generate from,
so if you had some components which needed to be typescript and others that
needed to be javascript, you can specify a different scaffold for each.

<!-- You can also use this method to create multiple components at once:

```bash
    builda my-component my-other-component
``` -->

## Migrating from Buildcom

If you previously used the [buildcom](https://npmjs.com/package/buildcom) package
then please be aware that although this is the spiritual successor to buildcom,
it is a completely different package. It is not compatible with buildcom.

If you rely on the legacy buildcom package, you may find that builda covers
all of the functionality of buildcom and then some.

Take a look in our [scaffold marketplace](/coming-soon) to see if there is a
scaffold that suits your needs, alternatively, it's pretty easy to [create your
own scaffolds](/coming-soon).
